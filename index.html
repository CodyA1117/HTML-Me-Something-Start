                <h2>Landscaper</h2>
                <p>This was hard work but rewarding to look back at what you have created. I worked 3 properties mainly over the summers when I was not in school.
                    Here I was able to mow grass, weed eat, build retaining walls, clear stumps and brush, and create gardens.

                <h2>Amazon Delivery Driver</h2>
                <p>This job was pretty fun, but required a lot of walking around. I would average 10+ miles a day walking on the job. But I was able to listen to podcasts all day so that was cool.</p>
